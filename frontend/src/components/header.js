              <p>Due to the closure of many public libraries, many have lost the community space once afforded to them. Book Me Up is a chance for communities to create their own public libraries, uploading books that have already been read for others to enjoy. So upload a book, and enjoy the feeling of discovering a new read from someone in your own community.</p>
